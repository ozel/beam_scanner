# quick notes: (FIXME: create README.md)
# 1. run this script with Python 3.9 or higher
# 2. important dependencies: asyncpio, aiohttp, uvloop, pip install git+https://github.com/spthm/asyncpio.git
# 3. there's a simulation mode (see below), a RPi with GPIOs is not mandatory (but async_p_io must be still installed!)

# for GPIO access on a Raspberry Pi, pigpiod must be running with 1 Âµs sample rate:
# sudo pigpiod -s 1
# for testing or when not running on RPi, use simulate=True in MicrobeamInterfaceRpi()
# random hits with Gaussian distribution will be generated in this case

# multiple TCP clients may connect to port 8188 and get run_start & run id, run_stop and x/y position messages
# optionally, if wait_for_client_ack=True is set (see below), the *main* TCP client (=first one that was connected) 
# must reply with any message & new line (e.g. "ack\n") before advancing the ion beam to the next step
# => read all registers of the ASIC and do what you need to check for a SEU, then send "ack\n" to the server

# example nc session:
# $ nc localhost 8188
# start_run 11
# pos -99 -93
# ack (<= user input)
# pos -50 -93
# ack
# pos 0 -93
# ack
# pos 50 -93
# ack
# pos 99 -93
# ack
# stop_run
